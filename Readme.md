Portfoilio Assessment 2019

How I came up with my idea to design my portfolio like I have came down to just wanting something that was different but unique, something that would stand out from anyone else.

Design Process

When i first started thinking about what i wanted to do for my portfolio I had already built a simple webpage template from listening to tutorials about html and css, so when it came to learning that we had to do a portfolio for our next assessment i just had to take what i already had and then add more things as we learnt more about html and css.

I changed my mind about what i wanted it to look like a few times during the design process but the main factor of what i wanted it to do kept consistent. I wanted a front page that welcomed the user and get them to click a button so that the screen would scroll down and the navbar would appear. Something i haven't seen a lot of websites do, which made me jump straight onto that idea cause i thought it'd look neat.

I first started with my navbar up the top and have it glow but as i went on i found myself not liking that idea so i scrapped it for just plain text but still have it so that when you hovered your mouse over the link it would light up. Next i started to add my pages, I decided to use my portfolio to show off my photography skills as well as the skills i had learnt from the html and css lessons. I ran into problems with the images being too big for a mobile phone so i went with a grid to make them all fit onto a mobile screen.

After the portfolio page i decided to create an "About me" page which later turned into "My Story", here i wrote down a few things about myself and how i came into becoming a beginner full-stack web developer. I then ran into a wall. I found out that we needed at least four pages and i was stumped for ideas, I didn't know what to add, But then i thought of adding a contact page and set off to find out what type of contact form i could make. I found a form template that was just a basic one so simple enough for me to work on but not too basic as it has a transparent background which i found out override my current background which was annoying. So i just had to put my background in my body instead. Problem solved!

Next came the Blog page, which I just added some links to some of my written blogs i had made over the past few weeks.
But then i found out that we had to make a sperate page for each blog post! (NO... PLEASE GOD NO...) I thought i was finished and could just concentrate on my documentation but alas i was foiled and had to go back to my blog page and make a blog page with all of my blogs from medium. 

Problems

Some problems i had with my portfolio were:

: The headings weren't aligning properly
: The navbar was being stupid
: My color scheme wasn't matching

After the "My Story" page i made a contact page and then a contact form. I decided to go with one that was kind of transparent so that you could still see the background but also responsive at the same time, so i went exploring the world wide web for ways to do a contact form and make it responsive
