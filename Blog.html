        <h3>Road to becoming a web developer</h3>
        <p>Programming, Coding, Web Designing! It sounds terrifying right? Well no, it doesn’t.<br />
            Writing a program of code while it sounds bad, It’s actually quite easy.<br /> As someone who hasn’t had much experience with writing code i felt quite nervous starting my journey to becoming a web developer.<br />
            Coming from a background with some IT background, I know a little bit about computers<br /> but when it comes to coding and writing a program to build applications on a computer I know nothing.<br />
            Come join me on my journey to become a junior web developer and learn how to build some computer code.</p>
        </ul>
        <ul>
        <h3>All Good Things come to an end</h3>
        <p>As I end week 1 of the Coder Academy web development bootcamp and enter week 2,<br /> I get to look back at all the things I’ve learnt so far.
            I look back at how I struggled to learn things and learnt how to go to my classmates if i need help,<br /> which has been a huge help. 
            In the first week I learnt about what Ruby is and how to code using Ruby and what all of the different ways to get an answer.<br />
            Week 2 will bring new and exciting challenges and ways to learn<br /> more about this wonderful world of web development and programming. 
            To start off we will be going over Arrays and what they do.
            Continue to follow me through my journey as i become a web developer in 6 months.</p>

        <h3>Week 3 — Terminal apps and dealing with headaches and programming</h3>
        <p>Week three of my coder academy experience and this week we have our first assessment<br />. 
            To build an application in the ruby coding language. It’s hard not to feel like you’re below everyone else when<br /> they’re coming up with ideas to make a game run in their terminal apps 
            while you’re just simply trying to get a simple measly multiple question application to just work.<br /> Talking to friends who also struggle with similar difficulties when it comes to coding and it’s helped me<br />
            to change my view from thinking that I’m not smart to<br /> “Hey maybe (“x” programming language) is just a little too out of your depth now, you’ll get there in time!”<br /> which is a really big help for my confidence 
            going into this assessment. “always strive to be your best”
            Confidence — The big thing that everyone has or struggles with and i am no stranger to it especially confidence,<br /> and one of my biggest contributors is headaches. Man i just hate headaches and everything that comes with them,<br />
            they just suck so much and seeing as i’m spending days in front of the computer headaches<br /> and miagrains are bound to occur and it sucks whenever they do
            So in conclusion headaches can just go away<br /> and bring on week 3 of learning to become a web developer in 6 months!
            Follow me as i continue on my journey.</p>

            <h3>Ruby — A Perspective at what was.</h3>
            <p>Last week in coder academy we finished our first assessment for our fast track course for web development.<br />
            We also finished off learning about Ruby and now we’re on to HTML and CSS and learning about websites!!<br />
            During the week we were doing our terminal apps in ruby and during the process of writing and presenting the apps<br />
            I learnt that it doesn’t matter how much coding knowledge you have or even if you are super smart<br /> in coding everyone learns at their own pace 
            and that we all have different learning styles.<br /> It was very easy to look at everyone’s different apps that they made and think that what they made was way better<br />
            than yours but in the end everyone is here to learn and if they made a better app then you<br /> it just doesn’t matter just keep on learning and pushing yourself
            to learn more and you’ll do great.<br /> Since we’ll be starting to cover html and css this week,<br /> I’ve been going through and listening to online tutorials about html and css 
            to make sure I know what they’re talking about in the lessons,<br /> and then i’ll go back and listen to more tutorials to cement the stuff I learn in the classroom.

            <h3>Programming and Anxiety</h3>
            <p>Mental illness plays a very big role in our lives with 45% of all Australians<br /> and one in four people world wide who suffer from a mental illness.<br /> 
            With saying that… When i was fresh out of high school i was diagnosed with mild anxiety<br /> and i had been getting headaches for most of my life (well from what i can remember anyway).<br />
            I was also diagnosed with a small learning disease, I found it hard to keep up with high school<br /> and with that i was told that it’d be better if i left school and go to Tafe.<br /> 
            As i grew up i no longer saw my learning difficulty as a wall that i couldn’t get past<br /> but i started seeing it as a bully and that i needed to step up to this bully and tell it to go away.<br /> 
            So that’s exactly what i did, whenever i would start a new job or field of study<br /> I would set out to prove to myself and sometimes others that didn’t think i could do something that even though<br /> 
            I had so much more to do then others because i had to find how i learnt things best and sometimes that meant<br /> that I wouldn’t pass certain things because i would try to do things by myself and not ask for help.<br />
            Headaches have been with me since i could remember, they’ve impacted my life quite bad with them ranging from (okay, i can handle this) to (f#ck this!),<br /> They’ve been a constant annoyance and they’ve made me miss out on so much.<br />
            Last week was R U Okay? day and we had some people from class share about their struggles which was awesome!<br /> and it was great to see so many people care and cheer for the people who did share about what they are or have been through.<br />
            I sometimes wish that it was always like that, and always that easy to be able to come out<br /> and tell people that no you may not be okay some days and that mental illness of any kind<br /> whether it be as little as headaches to as big as depression and suicidal thoughts,<br />  
            there’s such a big concept that people should just suck it up and get over there struggles and that is not okay. People should be allowed to say what’s on their mind and be told “Thank you for sharing” or be told that people do care about your struggles and that you’re not alone.
            This week in class we’re working on our portfolio assessments where we have to create a Portfolio from what we’ve learnt so far from html and css<br />  and then upload it to the interwebs for people to see and then present it to the class.<br /> 
            Continue to follow me as i transform<br />  from being a guy with no coding experience to a full-stack web developer<br />  in just 6 months.</p>
